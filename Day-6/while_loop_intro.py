"""While Loop"""
# it a loop that will keep going until the condition is no longer true
# while something_is_true():
#     Do something repeatedly

number_of_hurdle = 6
while number_of_hurdle > 0:
    print(number_of_hurdle)
    number_of_hurdle -= 1
    #print(number_of_hurdle)

# difference between while loop and for loop
# for loop is important when you have a particular loop issues
# and you want the code to do a particular thing with each other
# MEANWHILE
# while loop is used when you do not care about the how many times the code have to run
# it important to know that while loop is a bit dangerous
# as it will keep running till the condition becomes false
"""infinite loop"""
# this is found when there is no stop in the while loop
